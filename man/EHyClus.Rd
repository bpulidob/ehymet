\arguments{
\item{curves}{Dataset containing the curves to apply a clustering algorithm.
The functional dataset can be one dimensional (\eqn{n \times p}) where n is the number of
curves and p the number of time points, or multidimensional (\eqn{n \times p \times k}) where k
represents the number of dimensions in the data}

\item{vars_combinations}{\code{integer} or \code{list}.
If \code{integer}, the method will automatically determine the best combinations
of variables. As many combinations will be selected as the value of the variable.
If \code{list},  each element of the list should be an atomic \code{vector} of strings with the
names of the variables. Combinations with non-valid variable names will be discarded.
If the list is non-named, the names of the variables are set to
vars1, ..., varsk, where k is the number of elements in \code{vars_combinations}.
Default to an \code{integer} with value \code{1}, i.e. it only uses the theoretically
best combination.}

\item{nbasis}{Number of basis for the B-splines. If , it will
be automatically set.}

\item{n_clusters}{Number of clusters to create}

\item{bs}{A two letter chatacter string indicating the (penalized) smoothing
basis to use. See \code{\link{smooth.terms}}.}

\item{clustering_methods}{character vector specifying at least one of the following
clustering methods to be computed: "hierarch", "kmeans", "kkmeans", "spc".}

\item{indices}{Names of the indices that need to be generated. They should be
one or more between 'EI', 'HI', 'MEI' and 'MHI'. Depending on the dimension on the data
they are calculated for one or multiple dimension}

\item{l_method_hierarch}{\code{list} of clustering methods for hierarchical
clustering}

\item{l_dist_hierarch}{\code{list} of distances for hierarchical clustering}

\item{l_dist_kmeans}{\code{list} of distances for kmeans clustering}

\item{l_kernel}{\code{list} of kernels}

\item{grid_ll}{lower limit of the grid.}

\item{grid_ul}{upper limit of the grid.}

\item{true_labels}{Vector of true labels for validation
(if it is not known true_labels is set to NULL)}

\item{verbose}{If \code{TRUE}, the function will print logs for about the execution of
some clustering methods. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{num_cores}{Number of cores to do parallel computation. 1 by default,
which mean no parallel execution.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
A list containing the clustering partition for each method and indexes
combination and a data frame containing the time elapsed for obtaining a
clustering partition of the indexes dataset for each methodology
