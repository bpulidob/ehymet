\title{Hypograph Index (HI) for a univariate functional dataset.}
\usage{
HI(curves, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{curves}{A matrix where each row represents a curve, and each column
represents values along the curve.}

\item{...}{Ignored.}
}
\value{
Return a numeric vector containing the HI for each curve
}
\description{
The Hypograph Index of a curve x is the proportion of curves in the sample
that are below x.
}
\examples{
x <- matrix(c(1,2,3,3,2,1,5,2,3,9,8,7), ncol = 3, nrow = 4)
HI(x)

y <- array(c(1,2,3, 3,2,1, 5,2,3, 9,8,7, -1,-5,-6, 2,3,0, -1,0,2, -1,-2,0),
dim = c(3,4,2))
