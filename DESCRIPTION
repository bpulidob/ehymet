Description: Implements a method for transforming a functional dataset in one or 
  multiple dimension into a multivariate dataset. This transformation is achieved 
  by applying the epigraph, hypograph, and their modified versions to both the 
  original curves and their first and second derivatives. he calculation of 
  indexes is adapted to the dimensionality of the functional dataset, with 
  specialized considerations for dependencies between dimensions in the 
  multidimensional case. This approach facilitates the extension of traditional 
  multivariate data analysis techniques to the functional setting. A key 
  application of this package is the EHyClus method which extends clustering 
  analysis for functional data in one or multiple dimension.
